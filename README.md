#  Chest X-Rays Report Generation 
## 📌 Project Description
This project focuses on generating medical reports from Chest X-ray images using a fine-tuned **GPT-2** model.  
The system combines **computer vision** and **natural language processing (NLP)** to assist in automated radiology reporting.

---

## 🚀 Features
- 🩻 **Dataset Preprocessing** – Cleans and merges image metadata with corresponding reports.  
- 🤖 **AI Model** – Uses **BLIP** for captioning and **GPT-2** for generating descriptive reports.  
- 📊 **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Handles missing values and visualizes dataset distribution.  
- 💾 **Model Saving** – Fine-tuned model is saved for future inference and deployment.

---

## 🛠️ Technology Stack
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Torch, Transformers)
- **Hugging Face Transformers** (for GPT-2 and BLIP model usage)
- **Kaggle Notebooks** (for training and execution)

---

## ⚡ How It Works
1. Dataset is preprocessed and cleaned.  
2. BLIP model generates captions from X-ray images.  
3. GPT-2 model is fine-tuned to generate radiology-style reports.  
4. The model is saved and can be deployed for inference.
